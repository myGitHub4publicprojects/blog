        <h1>Privacy policy</h1>
        <p>By using any of our websites, you are agreeing to abide by our Website Terms of Use Agreement.

Because some of the content on our websites is generated by users like you, we've established some ground rules for user behavior. Below is a summary of those ground rules, but our full Website Terms of Use Agreement always applies, and we strongly encourage you to read them.

We reserve the right to alter or amend our Website Terms of Use Agreement at any time and to remove or ban any content or any user at our sole discretion.
Do not hack, attack or copy our websites or services, or post any information on our websites that suggests or encourages how others may subvert or otherwise harm any of our websites or operations.
We watch behavior on our websites and moderate that behavior as needed, but because of the volume of user participation, and staff limitations, we don't catch everything. If you find something on our websites that you believe is inappropriate, please report it to us by clicking the "Remove" button to flag it to our attention, or by contacting us here.
If you post any content—comments, events, links, photographs, videos, etc.—on our websites, the following rules apply:

Anything you post on our websites is public. So make sure you're comfortable with the idea that anyone can view anything you post here.

By posting, you are affirming that you have a right to use the material and are obeying all copyright, privacy and other applicable laws and regulations. Do not copy material from other sources or otherwise post material for which you do not own the copyright or have not been granted the permission to post on our websites.
You own the content that you create, but by posting that content to any of our websites, you give us a nonexclusive license to store, distribute or use that content in any way we deem fit.
You may not post any content or use our services to do anything illegal or malicious. You are legally responsible for any libelous, defamatory or otherwise illegal content. If you post such content, you'll be responsible for indemnifying us against claims by third parties.
The object of our comments section is to provide a forum for intelligent, relevant, civil discourse. Please keep the conversation moving forward in a polite and friendly fashion and tone. Treat others as you'd like to be treated. If you can't be polite—don't say it.
